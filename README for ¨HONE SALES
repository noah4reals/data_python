From when phone selling begin to now we have created so many different mobile phone with different manufucturers.
here i'm am analyzing in this project the best selling phone trought the year.
And the different mark of mobile phone creators.
First we upload the dataframe.
with a little problem i have with the dataframe and i couldn't do it after so many research is that the sales number per million have 
type as "object". i could change it to string but it contain number like this "12 [56]" wich make it hard but i still continue to
analyze and create the best i could by creating charts with plot().
